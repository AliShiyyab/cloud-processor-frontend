            <Typography variant="body1" width={"66%"}>
                This project was developed as part of our Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity. Our goal was to create a 
                user-friendly, secure, and efficient dashboard tool for managing cloud-based and local resources.
                The system is built with cutting-edge technologies to ensure fast performance, intuitive usability, 
                and strong data protection.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" width={"66%"}>
                Throughout the development process, we analyzed modern cloud tools, implemented real-time 
                monitoring, and ensured security through encryption and access control. The result is a powerful 
                tool ideal for IT professionals and organizations managing infrastructure in dynamic cloud environments.
